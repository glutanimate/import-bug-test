**IMPORTANT: THIS ADD-ON IS STRICTLY FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES. DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS YOU WERE EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED TO. THE UPLOAD HERE IS PROVIDED SOLELY TO MAKE THE INSTALLATION MORE CONVENIENT FOR TESTERS. Thank you.**

This is an add-on designed to gather info on an elusive bug in Anki's add-on import system. Related bug reports: [1](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/issues/43), [2](https://github.com/Arthur-Milchior/anki-enhance-main-window/issues/45).

### USAGE

0. (Ideally: If you have the time and you're on Anki 2.1, temporarily disable all other add-ons under Tools → Add-ons by selecting them all and then clicking on "Toggle Enabled". Once they're all greyed out, proceed with the steps below.)
1. Install the add-on
2. Close Anki.
3. Start Anki. This might take a few seconds longer than usual as the add-on will perform a few tests to probe Anki's add-on import system. Once they are done, a prompt should appear informing you of whether your Anki installation is affected by the issue not.
   - **Should you be affected**: Please post the debug log in [this thread](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/35343-import-bug-test-debug-log-thread) over at the Anki support forums (no account needed). The debug log contains the following info: Your operating system, installed Anki-version, top-level files and folders in your add-on directory, and the status of the performed tests. Feel free to uninstall the add-on once you've posted your log!
   - **Should you be unaffected**: You're good to go! Feel free to uninstall the add-on.

_Thanks so much for your help!_
